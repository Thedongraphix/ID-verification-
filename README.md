## Potential Issues and Solutions

### 1. Authentication Issues

**Problem**: Unable to login or session expires unexpectedly

**Solution**:

- In this demo, data is stored in localStorage, which may be cleared

### 2. ID Card Not Showing

**Solution**:
- Ensure you're properly logged in
- Check the browser console for any errors
- Navigate to the dashboard first, then click "View Digital ID Card"
- If persistent, try re-registering with a different email

### 3. Verification Failures

**Problem**: ID card verification doesn't work

**Solution**:
- For the demo, use the format:
  - Card Number: KEWI-12345
  - Student ID: STU-12345
- Alternatively, register a new account and use your assigned card number
- Check for typos when entering the verification information

### 4. Mobile Display Issues
